> **Abstract:** *One of the greatest scientific challenges in network neuroscience is to create a representative map of a population of heterogeneous brain networks, which acts as a connectional fingerprint. The connectional brain template (CBT), also named network atlas, presents a powerful tool for capturing the most representative and discriminative traits of a given population while preserving its topological patterns. The idea of a CBT is to integrate a population of heterogeneous brain connectivity networks, derived from different neuroimaging modalities or brain views (e.g., structural and functional), into a unified holistic representation. Here we review current state-of-the-art methods designed to estimate well-centered and representative CBT for populations of single-view and multi-view brain networks. We start by reviewing each CBT learning method, then we introduce the evaluation measures to compare CBT representativeness of populations generated by single-view and multigraph integration methods, separately, based on the following criteria: centeredness, biomarker-reproducibility, node-level similarity, global-level similarity, and distance-based similarity. We demonstrate that the deep graph normalizer (DGN) method significantly outperforms other multi-graph and all single-view integration methods for estimating CBTs using a variety of healthy and disordered datasets in terms of centeredness, reproducibility (i.e., graph-derived biomarkers reproducibility that disentangle the typical from the atypical connectivity variability), and preserving the topological traits at both local and global graph-levels. Our code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/survey-multigraph-integration-methods.*

# Introduction

>**A connectional brain template (CBT)** is an integral graph-based fingrprint of a population of brain networks also regarded as an average connectome. CBTs are powerful tools for creating representative maps of brain connectivity, disentangling the typical from the atypical variations across the population samples. Estimating a well-centered and discriminative CBT for populations of heterogenous brain networks such as structural, functional, and morphological networks is more challenging since these networks sit on complex manifolds and there is no easy way to fuse them. Thus, we list here all papers of 7 years (2014-2020), some journals, and MICCAI (2019-2020) papers that fuse multiple brain network and identify biomarkers (distinctive connectivities fingerprinting) of different population such as healthy and disordered populations. The existing fusion models embedded in the papers are basing on:
* [geometric deep learning multi-view graph network normalization](#MultiGraph)
* [deep learning cluster-based graph network integration](#MultiGraph)
* [manifold optimization clustering-based network integration](#MultiGraph)
* [machine learning cluster-based network fusion](#singleView)

The diagram below illustrates the criteria used to evaluate the performance of the connectional brain templates generated for single-view graph integration methods and multi-view graphs fusion methods. This includes first graph centeredness using Frobenius distance, second, the graph-derived biomarker reproducibility where we identify the overlap of top $k$ discriminative nodes (ROIs) computed by the graph fusion methods and by an independent biomarker selection method, third the global-level similarity using both modularity and global efficiency measures, fourth the graph distance-based similarity where we compute Hamming and Jaccard distances. Finally, we include the graph node-wise similarity where we evaluate three behavior for the graph: integration behavior using participation coefficient, segregation behavior using local efficiency, and hubness behavior using the following centrality metrics: PageRank \citep{xing2004weighted}, Katz centrality \citep{katz1953new}, node strength \citep{barrat2004architecture}, random-walk centrality \citep{newman2005measure}, information centrality \citep{stephenson1989rethinking}, Laplacian centrality \citep{qi2012laplacian}, eigenvector centrality \citep{newman2008mathematics}, and betweeness centrality \citep{brandes2001faster}.
