>**Abstract: One of the greatest scientific challenges in network neuroscience is to create a representative map of a population of heterogeneous brain networks, which acts as a connectional fingerprint. The connectional brain template (CBT), also named network atlas, presents a powerful tool for capturing the most representative and discriminative traits of a given population while preserving its topological patterns. The idea of a CBT is to integrate a population of heterogeneous brain connectivity networks, derived from different neuroimaging modalities or brain views (e.g., structural and functional), into a unified holistic representation. Here we review current state-of-the-art methods designed to estimate well-centered and representative CBT for populations of single-view and multi-view brain networks. We start by reviewing each CBT learning method, then we introduce the evaluation measures to compare CBT representativeness of populations generated by single-view and multigraph integration methods, separately, based on the following criteria: centeredness, biomarker-reproducibility, node-level similarity, global-level similarity, and distance-based similarity. We demonstrate that the deep graph normalizer (DGN) method significantly outperforms other multi-graph and all single-view integration methods for estimating CBTs using a variety of healthy and disordered datasets in terms of centeredness, reproducibility (i.e., graph-derived biomarkers reproducibility that disentangle the typical from the atypical connectivity variability), and preserving the topological traits at both local and global graph-levels.**

>**A connectional brain template (CBT)** is an integral graph-based fingrprint of a population of brain networks also regarded as an average connectome. CBTs are powerful tools for creating representative maps of brain connectivity, disentangling the typical from the atypical variations across the population samples. Estimating a well-centered and discriminative CBT for populations of heterogenous brain networks such as structural, functional, and morphological networks is more challenging since these networks sit on complex manifolds and there is no easy way to fuse them. Thus, we list here all papers of 7 years (2014-2020), some journals, and MICCAI (2019-2020) papers that fuse multiple brain network and identify biomarkers (distinctive connectivities fingerprinting) of different population such as healthy and disordered populations. The existing fusion models embedded in the papers are basing on:
* [geometric deep learning multi-view graph network normalization](#MultiGraph)
* [deep learning cluster-based graph network integration](#MultiGraph)
* [manifold optimization clustering-based network integratio](#MultiGraph)
* [machine learning cluster-based network fusion](#singleView)
